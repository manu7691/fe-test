## Instructions


### Requirements

Build a small web app using the "on production" API for cheap flight information. The web app should have at least the
following components:

- A form which allows a user to choose an origin, a destination, and a date period. The origins/destinations should be
taken from a web service.


- When a button is pressed, a component which shows all the information relating to the cheapest flight between those
points, for the chosen date period.

This must be coded as SPA.

### Ways to reach the sky

#### Mandatory:

- Style (css) of the app:
    - Bootstrap SASS version with custom code using SASS. Use SVG files with some plane design?

- User experience considerations
    - Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication - Da Vinci

- Error handling
    - Show error messages from the API - Cheap flights

- Modularity (re-usability of component code)
    - Use of directives?

- Responsive web design (RWD)
    - Use Boostrap with extra classes xxxs, xxs or Media Queries

####  Optional but cool:

- Cross browser considerations
    - Autoprefixer.Check CanIuse website http://caniuse.com/ to check compatibilities on different browsers and versions

- Auto-completion (some data is interlinked, don't make the user thinks!) Work that goes above and beyond the brief
    - Use the API - Airport (IATA) codes. Cache that data? - https://github.com/ghiden/angucomplete-alt

- Automated testing
    - Karma/Cucumber/Mocha
